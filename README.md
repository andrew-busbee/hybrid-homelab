# üåê Hybrid Homelab

Welcome to my **Hybrid Homelab**! This repository combines local and cloud-based server configurations, providing a flexible and scalable environment for experimentation and learning.

## üöÄ Why Hybrid?
The term "Hybrid Homelab" reflects the integration of both on-premises and cloud resources. This approach allows for:
- Enhanced flexibility in resource management
- Access to diverse technologies
- A more resilient and scalable setup

## üß∞ What's Included?
- **Local Servers**: Docker Compose configurations for various applications hosted at home.
- **Cloud Servers**: Docker Compose files for services running in the cloud.
- **Monitoring**: Tools and configurations for tracking performance and health of services.
- **Kubernetes**: Future implementations for container orchestration.
- **Automation**: Scripts and tools to streamline deployment and management.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the journey of building your own hybrid environment!
