# ðŸš€ Kubernetes Magic in the Hybrid Homelab!

Welcome to the **Kubernetes** folder of my **Hybrid Homelab**! Here, you'll find the powerful manifests (YAML files) that orchestrate my local and cloud services like a maestro.

## ðŸŒŸ What's Brewing?
- **Self-Hosted Services**: Explore the configurations that run my personal tech playground at home.
- **Cloud Services**: Discover the enchanting setups that thrive in the cloud.
- **Dual-Deployed Services**: Some applications are running seamlessly as instances both locally and in the cloud.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running (locally or in the cloud).
2. Apply the configuration with `kubectl apply -f <your-manifest>.yaml`.
3. Watch as your services come to life!

Feel free to dive in and explore the magic of Kubernetes!
